I’m not sure if I have something worth sharing. I’ve never been one of those people who feels entitled--to anything. Especially sharing my point of view and life experiences. This probably has something to do with lack of confidence that stems from growing up poor (cue the sad violin and/or conservative eye rolling), but I’ll save that for another post. The thing is everybody with an internet connection nowadays can share their opinion for better or worse, and I don’t know if I want to add to the white noise of self importance. But here I am.

        <h4 class="post-date normal text-upper">6/29/2015</h4>
      </div>
      <p>I’ve started to write this inaugural blog post over and over again in Google drive (or is it Google docs?) over the past three years. I usually get to a point of self satisfaction (which is about two paragraphs of carefully crafted text), then rush to share it with my husband who  says something sweet and encouraging like “you should write more”, and I never touch it again. For the past four months, my four-month-old son has been the reason I never finish anything (a movie, a sandwich, or a blog post). But here it is--raggedy and rambling--enjoy!</p>
      <p>I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Or at least I want to be able to say “I’m a writer”. I’m impressed with the idea that someone could be smart enough, and self motivated enough to create a fictional world out of thin air or to make an argument and back it up with more words. It’s a creative skill that’s so bare bones, there’s nothing to hide behind. Either you’re a talented writer or not. As a painter, you can confuse people by using pretty colors, or as a filmmaker with pretty actors. And I know there are writers with beautiful, overly descriptive, wordy prose that can be just as distracting. But there’s still something about writing that demands raw talent.</p>

      <p>Writing is also a way to reframe my life of random jobs, and towns into something meaningful; I’m not just a gypsy-dilettante, I’ve been conducting research for my craft. I also like the fact that it’s pretty cheap--all you need is clarity of thought and a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>While there are some solid reasons that I want to write, there are many (four) reasons why I’m afraid to write:</p>
      <p><em>Writing is hard work</em>. It conjures up memories of college papers that I’d put off until an hour before it was due. I would literally have just enough time to type out the required pages with no time left for proofreading or editing. Most of the writers I’ve read about also hate the actual writing process. I want that perfect final draft. But I don’t have patience for the dozens of rewrites in between. I get overwhelmed by words, they get jumbled up on the page whenever I write or read. (I might be describing dyslexia--but I’m not going to procrastinate with a trip to WebMD right now.) Writing is a chore, but I have to find a way to like it.</p>
      <p><em>I’m not a good reader, how can I be a good writer?</em> This is probably tied to that potential dyslexia that I mentioned, but I have a hard time reading. I end up rereading the same paragraph trying to understand what’s on the page. Sometimes I can’t even make it to the end of a sentence without forgetting what was at the beginning. And this is usually a good indicator that I’m not interested in the subject--but it’s no excuse. I also let my mind wander while reading. I end up thinking about one of my four regular thoughts about body image, food, or regrets.</p>
      <p><em>I’m afraid of sucking</em>. I know that the path to greatness is paved with lots of failure, or something like that. I’ve heard many iterations of that quote. “I know I have to shovel out a lot of garbage before I can shovel gold.” (trademark Nicole Santora) And I don’t know all of the fancy things that English majors learn--like how to use that em dash that’s not an official em dash. Or how to use semi colons. Or fancy terms that include the word “narrative”.</p>
      <p><em>I’m not sure if I have something worth sharing.</em> I’ve never been one of those people who feels entitled--to anything. Especially sharing my point of view and life experiences. This probably has something to do with lack of confidence that stems from growing up poor (cue the sad violin and/or conservative eye rolling), but I’ll save that for another post. The thing is everybody with an internet connection nowadays can share their opinion for better or worse, and I don’t know if I want to add to the white noise of self importance. But here I am.</p>
